                    <h3>Claude Shannon</h3>
                    <p>Cryptanalysis hero in World War II that was only 21 years old when he wrote a thesis applying Boolean algebra 
                        to electronics. But his crown achievement was without a doubt his work on information theory with fundamental 
                        applications for sending data in telecommunications or calculating password strength with his entropy 
                        function.</p>

                        the banking sector. Fun fact, she was the recipient of the first Man of the Year award by the Data Processing

                    <p>That pile of papers in the photo is a printed version of the code written by this computer scientist for the 
                        on-board software for Apollo ships that put the first humans on the moon. She was a pioneer of making a 
                        career out of software engineering when that was not even a job.</p>
